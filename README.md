# FlipTracker
The Flip Tracker is a project that I am currently undertaking for my own personal use to keep track of my flips, buying and selling items on the market within the game Runescape. This will be made using the MERN stack and will make use of MongoDB databases and javascript functions needed for calculations and data manipulation.

FUTURE UPDATES
polishing up the calculations to take into account all possibilities.
Adding in symbols and correlative colours for better readiblity
Adding in ranks depending on earnings displaying a badge along with earnings.
Adding in more helpful statistics to help with flips e.g. hit/fail rate, most successful items, highest single flip earnings etc.
